## üçï Part D: Pricing and Ratings

This section explores how much money Pizza Runner has made, how extras affect pricing, and introduces a runner ratings system with a breakdown of delivery metrics.

###  1. If a Meat Lovers pizza costs $12 and Vegetarian costs $10 and there were no charges for changes - how much money has Pizza Runner made so far if there are no delivery fees?

**Description:**  
We calculate the total revenue based on the base price of pizzas (Meat Lovers: $12, Vegetarian: $10) for all successfully delivered orders. No extras or delivery fees are included in this calculation.

---

### 2. What if there was an additional $1 charge for any pizza extras?

**Description:**  
This scenario assumes an extra $1 is charged per topping listed in the `extras` column for each delivered pizza. We add this charge on top of the base pizza prices to compute the total revenue.

### 3. The Pizza Runner team now wants to add an additional ratings system that allows customers to rate their runner, how would you design an additional table for this new dataset - generate a schema for this new table and insert your own data for ratings for each successful customer order between 1 to 5.

**Description:**  
We propose and create a `customer_rating` table to store customer feedback on runners. This includes fields like `order_id`, `customer_id`, `runner_id`, and a `rating` between 1 and 5. Sample rating data is inserted for analysis.

### 4. Using your newly generated table - can you join all of the information together to form a table which has the following information for successful deliveries?
- customer_id  
- order_id  
- runner_id  
- rating  
- order_time  
- pickup_time  
- Time between order and pickup  
- Delivery duration  
- Average speed  
- Total number of pizzas

**Description:**  
We join multiple tables including `customer_orders`, `runner_orders`, and `customer_rating` to generate a comprehensive delivery summary with customer, timing, speed, and order quantity details.

###  5. If a Meat Lovers pizza was $12 and Vegetarian $10 fixed prices with no cost for extras and each runner is paid $0.30 per kilometre traveled - how much money does Pizza Runner have left over after these deliveries?

**Description:**  
Here we determine the business's net profit by subtracting runner payments (at $0.30/km) from the revenue generated by all successful orders, using fixed pizza prices and no charges for extras.
