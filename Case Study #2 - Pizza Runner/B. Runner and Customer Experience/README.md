# üçï Pizza Runner - Part B: Runner and Customer Experience

This folder contains SQL solutions for **Part B** of the [Pizza Runner case study](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-2/) from the 8-Week SQL Challenge by Danny Ma.

The focus of this part is to explore and analyze the delivery side of operations ‚Äî understanding how runners and customer experience metrics are performing based on available data.

## üìä Dataset Overview

In this section, we dive into operational insights involving:

- Runner registrations  
- Delivery timings and behavior  
- Preparation vs. order size relationships  
- Distance and speed trends  
- Delivery success metrics

---

## üîç Key Questions Answered

1. **How many runners signed up for each 1 week period?**  
   Analyze registration trends weekly starting from `2021-01-01`.

2. **What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?**  
   Use timestamps to estimate average arrival efficiency.

3. **Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?**  
   Investigate if order size impacts preparation time.

4. **What was the average distance travelled for each customer?**  
   Aggregate delivery distances per customer.

5. **What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?**  
   Examine consistency and variability in delivery performance.

6. **What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?**  
   Analyze delivery speed and identify patterns.

7. **What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?**  
   Evaluate runner performance based on success rate.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or navigate to this folder.
2. Use any SQL IDE or platform (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite with minor modifications).
3. This folder contains:
   - `part_b_runner_experience.sql`: All SQL queries written for this part.
   - `part_b_runner_experience.md`: Each question with the corresponding query and output table for reference.
4. Run queries from the SQL file or explore the Markdown file for a documented walkthrough of the solutions and results.

## üìù Notes

- The analysis assumes clean and transformed datasets.
- Calculations are based on approximations due to limited timestamp granularity.
